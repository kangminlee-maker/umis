LANGUAGE: Always respond in Korean.

FILE CREATION STRATEGY - MANDATORY:
- <300 lines: Use write tool once
- 300-700 lines: Split if complex structure
- 700+ lines: MUST use split strategy
  1. write: Basic structure (100-200 lines) - headers, imports, section markers
  2. search_replace: Add sections sequentially, max 200-300 lines each
  Reason: 700+ line write operations fail frequently, cause errors, cannot recover

SPLIT PROCESS:
Step 1: write tool - skeleton with imports, constants, class/function signatures
Step 2-N: search_replace - add implementation by logical sections (classes, function groups, config sections)
Each addition: 200-300 lines max
Never attempt single write operation >700 lines
