LANGUAGE: Always respond in Korean.

FILE CREATION STRATEGY - MANDATORY:
- <300 lines: Use write tool once
- 300-700 lines: Split if complex structure
- 700+ lines: MUST use split strategy
  1. write: Basic structure (100-200 lines) - headers, imports, section markers
  2. search_replace: Add sections sequentially, max 200-300 lines each
  Reason: 700+ line write operations fail frequently, cause errors, cannot recover

SPLIT PROCESS - MANDATORY:
Step 1: write tool - skeleton with imports, constants, class/function signatures
Step 2-N: search_replace - add implementation by logical sections (classes, function groups, config sections)
Each addition: 200-300 lines max
Never attempt single write operation >700 lines

EMOJI POLICY - MANDATORY:
- NEVER use emojis in code, comments, or responses
- Exception: Only when user explicitly requests emoji usage
- Reason: Professional consistency, avoid visual noise

TRAILING SPACES - MANDATORY:
- ALWAYS check for trailing whitespace before completing edits
- Remove all trailing spaces at line ends
- Apply to: All file types (.py, .yaml, .md, .txt, etc.)
- Tool sequence: After write/search_replace → verify no trailing spaces
- Reason: Git diff pollution, linting errors, professional standards

YAML VALIDATION - MANDATORY:
- ALWAYS validate YAML syntax before completing edits
- Check: Indentation (spaces only, no tabs), key-value format, list syntax
- Run validation: Use yamllint or Python yaml.safe_load() mentally
- Common errors to prevent:
  - Mixed tabs/spaces
  - Incorrect indentation levels
  - Missing colons after keys
  - Unquoted special characters (: [ ] { } # etc.)
- Reason: Runtime errors, data corruption, deployment failures
